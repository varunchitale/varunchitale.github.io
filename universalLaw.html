							<p>
							In common law legal systems, black letter laws are the well-established legal rules that are no longer subject to reasonable dispute. Some examples are the <strong>black-letter law</strong> of contracts or the <strong>black-letter law</strong> of trademarks. Black-letter law can be contrasted with legal theory or unsettled legal issues.

							Following are some of the laws extracted from the entire* Indian Income-Tax universe. However, the ones listed here are not related to any section, article or income tax in itself. These are some of the laws that state every<sup>+</sup> individual's rights. These rights are sometimes stated directly: <i>"The golden principle of law is that no person should be condemned unheard."</i>, whereas they need interpretation in other cases: <i>"The quantum of penalty to which a person can be subjected in connection with the commission of an offence is to be determined with reference to the law governing the matter as it stood on the date of commission of the concerned offence."</i>
